# Case Study: Netflix Recommendation System

## Overview

Netflix serves personalized recommendations to millions of users. Key challenges include scale, real-time personalization, and cold start.

## Key Components

1. **Offline Algorithms**: Matrix factorization, deep learning
2. **Nearline Processing**: Real-time user behavior updates
3. **Online Serving**: Low-latency recommendation API
4. **A/B Testing**: Continuous experimentation

## Architecture Patterns

- **Hybrid Approach**: Multiple algorithms combined
- **Candidate Generation**: Fast retrieval of candidates
- **Ranking**: Fine-tuned ordering of candidates
- **Feature Store**: Centralized feature management

## Key Learnings

- Pre-computation vs real-time trade-offs
- Importance of experimentation infrastructure
- Handling scale (millions of users, billions of interactions)
