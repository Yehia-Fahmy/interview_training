# ML System Design Challenges

This directory contains system design challenges focused on machine learning systems, particularly relevant for ML engineers and AI Improvement Engineers.

## Challenges

1. **Challenge 01: LLM Serving System** - Design a scalable system for serving large language models
2. **Challenge 02: Model Training Pipeline** - Design a distributed training pipeline for large-scale ML models
3. **Challenge 03: Feature Store** - Design a feature store for both training and serving
4. **Challenge 04: Recommendation System** - Design an end-to-end recommendation system

## How to Use

1. Read each challenge carefully
2. Follow the interview framework from `../INTERVIEW_GUIDE.md`
3. Design the system (45-60 minutes)
4. Draw diagrams and explain your design
5. Discuss trade-offs and operational concerns
6. Review the example solutions (if available)

## Practice Tips

- Time yourself (45-60 minutes per challenge)
- Think out loud as you design
- Ask clarifying questions
- Start simple, then iterate
- Always discuss trade-offs
- Consider operational concerns (monitoring, debugging, failures)
