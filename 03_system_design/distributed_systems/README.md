# System Design - Distributed Systems

These exercises are **discussion-based** (no coding). Practice explaining your design decisions, trade-offs, and architecture choices.

## Exercises

All exercises are documented in **[EXERCISES.md](EXERCISES.md)**:

1. **Design a Scalable Web Crawler** - Distributed systems, scaling, reliability
2. **Design a Distributed Cache System** - Caching strategies, consistency, scalability
3. **Design a Real-time Analytics System** - Stream processing, real-time computation
4. **Design a Message Queue System** - Message queues, pub-sub, reliability

## How to Practice

1. **Read the problem** carefully
2. **Design the system** on paper/whiteboard (no code)
3. **Explain your decisions** out loud (as in interview)
4. **Discuss trade-offs** for each design choice
5. **Consider scale** (1M, 10M, 1B users/data points)
6. **Review** common patterns and solutions

## Evaluation Criteria (8090 Interview)

- Technical depth of your design
- Ability to clarify technical details
- Rationale behind design choices
- Understanding of distributed systems concepts
- Scalability and reliability considerations
