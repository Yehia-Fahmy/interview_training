- [ ] Key learnings: Load balancing, caching, database scaling

### Day 6-7: Mock Practice (4 hours)
- [ ] Practice 2-3 challenges with timer (45-60 min each)
- [ ] Record yourself or practice with friend
- [ ] Review `case_studies/case_study_01_chatgpt.md` (30 min) - LLM Serving Architecture

## Week 2: Refinement & Additional Practice (Optional)

### Day 8-9: Additional Challenges
- [ ] Recommendation System (`ml_systems/challenge_04_recommendation_system.md`)
- [ ] Real-time Analytics (`distributed_systems/challenge_02_real_time_analytics.md`)

### Day 10-11: Case Studies
- [ ] Recommendation System (`case_studies/case_study_02_netflix_recommendations.md`)
- [ ] Real-time Matching (`case_studies/case_study_03_uber_realtime.md`)

### Day 12-14: Final Prep
- [ ] Review `CHEAT_SHEET.md` daily
- [ ] Practice explaining designs out loud
- [ ] Mock interview with peer/mentor

## 🎯 Priority Order (If Very Limited Time)

### Must Do (Minimum 3-4 days):
1. **Day 1**: Framework + Cheat Sheet (2 hours)
2. **Day 2**: LLM Serving challenge (3 hours)
3. **Day 3**: Feature Store challenge (3 hours)
4. **Day 4**: Mock practice (2-3 challenges, 4 hours)

### Should Do (If you have 1 week):
- Add Training Pipeline challenge
- Add Scalable API challenge
- Review LLM Serving case study

### Nice to Have (If you have 2 weeks):
- All remaining challenges
- All case studies
- Multiple mock interviews

---

## 📝 Daily Practice Routine

### Morning (30 min)
- Review `CHEAT_SHEET.md`
- Review 5-step framework
- Practice clarifying questions

### Afternoon (2-3 hours)
- Work through one challenge
- Time yourself (45-60 min)
- Think out loud

### Evening (30 min)
- Review your design
- Identify improvements
- Review case studies

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

Before your interview, ensure you can:
- [ ] Explain the 5-step framework
- [ ] Ask good clarifying questions
- [ ] Draw simple architecture diagrams
- [ ] Discuss common trade-offs
- [ ] Explain ML system patterns (two-stage, feature store)
- [ ] Discuss scaling strategies
- [ ] Consider operational concerns

## 🎯 Focus Areas for ML Engineer Role

**Most Important:**
1. ML System Architecture (LLM serving, training pipelines)
2. Feature Store design
3. Model serving optimization
4. Distributed systems basics

**Less Critical (but still useful):**
- General distributed systems (scalable APIs)
- Data pipelines (if time permits)

---

**Remember**: Quality over quantity. Better to deeply understand 3-4 challenges than to skim 10!
