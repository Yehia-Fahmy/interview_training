# Data/ML Coding - Easy Exercises

These exercises focus on fundamental ML concepts, model implementation, and basic evaluation.

## Exercises

All exercises are documented in **[EXERCISES.md](EXERCISES.md)**:

1. **Classification Model from Scratch**
2. **Model Evaluation Metrics**
3. **Feature Engineering Pipeline**
4. **End-to-End ML Pipeline**
5. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing with Pandas** (NEW)
6. **Advanced Feature Engineering with Pandas and Scikit-learn** (NEW)
7. **Model Training Pipeline with Scikit-learn** (NEW)
8. **Cross-validation and Hyperparameter Tuning** (NEW)

### New Exercises (5-8)

Exercises 5-8 focus on practical data science workflows using pandas, scikit-learn, and other commonly used ML libraries:

- **Exercise 5**: Data cleaning and preprocessing with pandas
- **Exercise 6**: Advanced feature engineering (temporal, aggregated, interaction features)
- **Exercise 7**: Model training pipeline with sklearn
- **Exercise 8**: Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

These exercises emphasize real-world data manipulation and ML pipeline construction.
