# Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip or conda

## Installation

1. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. **Install required packages**:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn scipy
pip install memory-profiler line-profiler  # For profiling exercises
pip install pytest  # For testing your solutions
```

## Optional Dependencies

For advanced exercises:
```bash
# For ML exercises
pip install torch transformers sentence-transformers

# For evaluation
pip install nltk rouge-score

# For web scraping/system design practice
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## Getting Started

1. **Start with Code Challenge exercises**:
   - Navigate to `01_code_challenge/easy/`
   - Read the problem statement
   - Implement your solution
   - Compare with expected concepts

2. **Progress to ML exercises**:
   - Work through `02_data_ml_coding/` exercises
   - Focus on code quality and design rationale
   - Use AI assistance as you would in the interview

3. **Practice System Design**:
   - Read `03_system_design/` exercises
   - Design systems on paper/whiteboard
   - Practice explaining your decisions

## Tips

- **Time yourself**: Practice under interview time constraints
- **Explain out loud**: Practice articulating your thought process
- **Review solutions**: Compare with best practices after solving
- **Iterate**: Don't just solve once - optimize and refactor

## Interview Preparation Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Code Challenge exercises (all difficulty levels)
- **Week 3**: ML Coding exercises (focus on production concerns)
- **Week 4**: System Design exercises (practice explaining designs)
- **Week 5**: Mock interviews and review

Good luck! 🚀
