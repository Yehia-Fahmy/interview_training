# Practice Exercises

This directory contains hands-on coding exercises for each week of the roadmap.

## Structure

Exercises are organized by week and topic:

- **Week 1 (PyTorch)**: `ex_01_*` through `ex_04_*`
- **Week 2 (Optimization)**: `ex_05_*` through `ex_09_*`
- **Week 3 (GPU/CUDA)**: `ex_10_*` through `ex_14_*`
- **Week 4 (Kernels)**: `ex_15_*` through `ex_19_*`
- **Week 5 (TensorRT)**: `ex_20_*` through `ex_24_*`
- **Week 6 (Distributed)**: `ex_25_*` through `ex_29_*`
- **Week 7 (Profiling)**: `ex_30_*` through `ex_34_*`
- **Week 8 (System Design)**: `ex_35_*` through `ex_39_*`

## How to Use

1. Read the corresponding week's README first
2. Attempt each exercise before looking at solutions
3. Profile and optimize your solutions
4. Compare with reference implementations (if available)

## Exercise Format

Each exercise includes:
- Problem statement
- Learning objectives
- Starter code (if applicable)
- Hints (if needed)
- Expected outcomes

## Requirements

Most exercises require:
- PyTorch 2.0+
- CUDA toolkit (for GPU exercises)
- TensorRT (for TensorRT exercises)
- Triton (for Triton exercises)

See `requirements.txt` for full dependency list.
