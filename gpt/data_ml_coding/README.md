# Data / ML Coding Track

These exercises simulate the end-to-end work you might perform during 8090.ai's Data/ML coding interview. Each level nudges you toward production-quality workflows: reproducibility, evaluation, documentation, and communication.

Completing the prompts in order is recommended, but feel free to revisit earlier levels to tighten polish or explore alternative modeling choices.
