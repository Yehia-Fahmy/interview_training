# System Design Practice Track

Use these prompts to rehearse the conversational system design interview. Each scenario intentionally reflects Software Factory-style problems: orchestrating agent workflows, delivering reliable automation, and embedding measurement loops.

For each prompt:
1. Draft requirements and constraints (explicit + assumed).
2. Outline a high-level architecture diagram (whiteboard, Excalidraw, etc.).
3. Dive into key subsystems (data stores, queues, model serving, evaluation, observability).
4. Address trade-offs, failure scenarios, rollout strategy, and metrics.

Prompts are grouped into foundational, intermediate, and advanced tiers.
