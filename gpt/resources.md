# Supplementary Resources

Use the lists below to deepen coverage of the themes highlighted in the roadmap. Prioritize quality over quantity—pick one resource per category, ingest it deeply, and document key takeaways.

## Company & Product Context
- 8090.ai overview (public interviews and press): search for Chamath Palihapitiya discussing the "Software Factory" vision to understand the reliability-first positioning.
- Track thought leadership on AI agent evaluation and productionization—focus on blog posts or talks that stress measurement and guardrails.

## Python & Systems Foundations
- **CPython internals**: “Python in a Nutshell” (optimization chapters) or the official docs on the `sys` and `gc` modules.
- **Performance tuning**: `pycon` talks on profiling (`cProfile`, `line_profiler`) and memory debugging (`tracemalloc`).
- **Concurrency**: Articles comparing threading vs. asyncio for I/O-bound services.

## Machine Learning & LLM Operations
- **Experiment tracking**: MLflow quickstart, Weights & Biases system guides, or open-source alternatives like AimStack.
- **LLM evaluation**: Papers on automated eval harnesses (e.g., HELM, OpenAI Evals) and blog posts describing guardrail implementation.
- **Model monitoring**: Readings on data drift detection, concept drift, and post-deployment validation (Evidently AI guides are concise).

## System Design for Data/ML Platforms
- **Streaming pipelines**: Confluent or Materialize architecture blogs on exactly-once semantics and state management.
- **Feature stores & MLOps**: Feast documentation, Tecton whitepapers, or Google’s “Rules of ML” (sections on production).
- **Reliability**: Google SRE workbook chapters on incident response, SLOs, and error budgets.

## Practice & Mock Interview Platforms
- **Coding drills**: LeetCode (Hard array/string problems), Codeforces (performance focus), and Project Euler (numerical stability).
- **ML tasks**: Kaggle micro-challenges, DrivenData competitions, and Hugging Face datasets.
- **System design**: ByteByteGo newsletter, Alex Xu’s books, or community mock interview recordings.

## Communication & Storytelling
- Practice the "Situation → Approach → Trade-offs → Results → Next" structure when presenting solutions.
- Record yourself explaining a solution, then evaluate clarity, pacing, and technical depth.
- Collect 2–3 anecdotes that highlight collaboration, debugging resilience, and data-informed decision making—they often surface in wrap-up questions.
