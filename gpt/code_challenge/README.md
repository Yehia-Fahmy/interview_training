# Python Code Challenge Track

Three escalating exercises mirror the style of 8090.ai's Python code challenge. Treat them as time-boxed sessions and emphasize correctness, profiling, and clarity under constraints.

- `easy`: Rolling statistics over streaming logs.
- `medium`: Critical-path analysis for dependency graphs.
- `hard`: Memory-bounded quantile estimation for latency monitoring.

Each folder ships with a starter implementation and retro template—use those to practice recording trade-offs and follow-up ideas.
