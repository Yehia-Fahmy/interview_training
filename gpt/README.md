# 8090.ai Machine Learning Interview Prep

This repository curates a guided practice plan tailored to the Improvement Engineer interview track at 8090.ai. It blends a time-bound study roadmap with progressively harder exercises aligned to the three major interview formats: the Python code challenge, the Data/ML coding session, and the system design deep dive.

## Company & Product Snapshot
- 8090.ai (co-founded by Chamath Palihapitiya) is building an AI-first "Software Factory" that delivers fully managed, production-grade software for customers by automating large parts of the software development lifecycle.
- Software Factory emphasizes reliability and predictable delivery over novelty demos, pairing agentic AI workflows with rigorous evaluation, observability, and customer-specific guardrails.
- The Improvement Engineer role focuses on iterating on these AI-powered production systems: instrumenting agents, supervising quality, building evaluation tooling, and standing up automation around the ML lifecycle.

## Interview Overview
- `Code Challenge`: 75–90 minute Python session emphasizing correctness, performance, and lower-level reasoning (memory, complexity, data layout, numerical stability). Limited external help—assume you can check syntax but not strategy.
- `Data/ML Coding`: End-to-end data science or ML task where high-quality engineering, documentation, and the ability to justify design trade-offs matter as much as modeling accuracy. Full AI assistance is allowed.
- `System Design`: Conversational deep dive into designing data/ML-heavy distributed systems, highlighting architecture choices, reliability, observability, and operational strategy.

## Repository Layout
- `roadmap.md`: 6-week preparation timeline with weekly objectives, checkpoints, and deliverables.
- `code_challenge/`: Python-focused drills that escalate from fundamentals to performance tuning topics relevant to the code challenge.
- `data_ml_coding/`: End-to-end ML exercises spanning exploratory analysis, modeling, evaluation, and deployment-style deliverables.
- `system_design/`: Scenario prompts to rehearse whiteboard/system walk-through conversations.
- `resources.md`: Curated reading and practice links mapped to roadmap milestones.

## How to Use This Repo
1. Read `roadmap.md` to plan your preparation cadence. Each week references concrete tasks in the subdirectories plus reflection questions.
2. Work through practice prompts in order of difficulty, but feel free to skip ahead if you already master a topic.
3. For each exercise, treat the provided starter files as the beginning of your solution—clone them to a sandbox, implement, and document findings in the included reflection templates.
4. After finishing a module, rehearse the debrief: explain your approach, metrics, trade-offs, and how you would productionize improvements. This mirrors 8090.ai's emphasis on clarity and rationale.
5. Track notes, open questions, and follow-ups in a journal (personal or `notes.md`) so you can iterate deliberately.

## Next Steps
- Start with Week 0 in `roadmap.md` to baseline your strengths and logistics (Zoom setup, hardware checks).
- Schedule recurring mock sessions covering each interview type—solo, with peers, or via online platforms.
- As you progress, update or extend the exercises to mirror any new information you learn about 8090.ai's tooling or stack.

Good luck! Treat this repository as a living workbook—adapt it to your learning style and the specific signals you want to send during the interviews.
