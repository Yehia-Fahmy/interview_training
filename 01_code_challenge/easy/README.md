# Code Challenge - Easy Exercises

These exercises focus on fundamental Python concepts and basic optimizations.

## Exercises

All exercises are documented in **[EXERCISES.md](EXERCISES.md)**:

1. **Memory-Efficient List Operations**
2. **String Builder Optimization**
3. **Choosing the Right Data Structure**
4. **Understanding Algorithm Complexity**

## Getting Started

### Starter Scripts

Each exercise has a starter script with minimal hints:
- `starter_01.py` - Memory-Efficient List Operations
- `starter_02.py` - String Builder Optimization
- `starter_03.py` - Choosing the Right Data Structure
- `starter_04.py` - Understanding Algorithm Complexity

### Automated Testing

Run the automated test suite to verify your solutions:

```bash
# Test all exercises
python test_all.py

# Test a specific exercise
python test_all.py --exercise 1
python test_all.py --exercise 2
python test_all.py --exercise 3
python test_all.py --exercise 4
```

The test runner will:
- ✅ Compare your solution against expected outputs
- ⚠️ Show comparisons with inefficient implementations
- 📊 Measure performance improvements
- 💡 Provide detailed feedback

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for more details.

### Solution Files

Reference solutions are in separate files (`solution_01.py` through `solution_04.py`) so you won't see them while working. Only check these after completing your implementation!
