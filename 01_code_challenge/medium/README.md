# Code Challenge - Medium Exercises

These exercises focus on intermediate Python concepts, concurrency, and performance optimization. Each exercise tests your ability to write efficient, production-ready code that handles real-world constraints.

## Getting Started

1. **Read the exercise description** in the corresponding markdown file
2. **Implement your solution** in the `starter_XX.py` file
3. **Run the test suite** with: `python test_all.py`
4. **Compare your solution** with the reference solution in `solution_XX.py` after attempting

## Running Tests

Test all exercises:
```bash
python test_all.py
```

Test a specific exercise:
```bash
python test_all.py --exercise 1
```

The test suite will:
- Verify correctness of your implementation
- Measure performance metrics (time, memory)
- Compare against baseline implementations
- Provide a grade based on correctness and efficiency

## Exercises

All exercises are documented in **[EXERCISES.md](EXERCISES.md)**:

1. **Custom Memory-Efficient Data Structure** - Data structure design, memory optimization
2. **Threading vs Multiprocessing** - Python GIL, concurrency, parallel processing
3. **Memory Profiling and Optimization** - Memory profiling, optimization techniques
4. **Efficient Caching Implementation** - Caching algorithms, decorators, memory management

## Assessment Criteria

Each exercise is graded on:
1. **Correctness (60%)** - Does it produce the correct results?
2. **Efficiency (30%)** - Performance compared to baseline/reference
3. **Code Quality (10%)** - Clean, readable, well-documented code

## Tips

- Start with correctness, then optimize
- Use appropriate tools for profiling and measurement
- Read the exercise descriptions carefully for requirements
- Test with both small and large datasets
- Consider edge cases (empty inputs, large inputs, etc.)
